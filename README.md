# Odin Recipes

## Introduction
Odin Recipes is a simple web project where I will build a basic recipe website using HTML and CSS. This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum and aims to reinforce my understanding of:

- Basic HTML structure and elements
- Linking pages using relative paths
- Proper use of headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Implementing images in a webpage

## Goals
By completing this project, I will have demonstrated my ability to create structured HTML pages and lay the foundation for styling with CSS in future projects.

## Reflection
*(To be completed at the end of the project, reviewing key learnings and challenges.)*
